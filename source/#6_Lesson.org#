- So we've got some code that will let us pick up all the fruit on the board.
- Let's see how we do against a simpleBot that has been writte to compete against us.
- Go into the testing directory, then into a directory called assets, then into a directory called js.
- In there you should find a bot called simplebot.js. This is your opponent.
- Open simplebot.js in a text editor.
- At the top of simplebot.js is some code that looks like this.
#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
var SimpleBot = {
    makeMove: function() {
       // to disable to opponent, uncomment the next line
       return PASS;
#+END_SRC
- Comment out the =return PASS;= so it looks like this.
#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
var SimpleBot = {
    makeMove: function() {
       // to disable to opponent, uncomment the next line
       // return PASS;
#+END_SRC
- Save the file.
- Now you have a bot to play against.
** Run It
:PROPERTIES:

:END:

- Try running your bot from last lesson against the simpleBot.js
- How did you do?
- Change the default game board and see how you do on different boards.
